# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — a playful yet practical Python script that performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication and division** between two numbers... like a boss 😎

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This calculator:
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers
- Calculates the:
  - ✅ Sum  
  - ✅ Difference  
  - ✅ Product  
  - ✅ Quotient  
- Displays the results in a clean, readable format

> Perfect for beginners learning Python basics and input/output operations!

## 📌 Features

- Handles **float inputs** to support decimals
- Clean and easy-to-read Python code
- Lighthearted and beginner-friendly comments

## 🧠 How It Works

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
